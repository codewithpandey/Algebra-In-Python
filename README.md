Trying to solve algebric expressions in Python.

# Research and Analysis for the Project

Let's solve algebra using python programs.
In an algebric expression we don not have a numeric value which can be calculated.
So we have to do evry step that we do in our copies.
For example normally by multiplication we mean to multiply two values. But as for in algbra we have to perform a concatination operation.
i.e. a * b = ab.
Again, if there is any exponent for the given variable they should be added and also the coefficients are to be multiplied arithmetically.
for division we will leave as it is i.e. a/b

Starting with addition:
1. If there are two same variables with no co-efficients such as a + a, then we have to assume there co-efficients as 1 and while adding them there co-efficients add upto 2, and there is left only one variable and the final answer is 2a.

2. If there are two same variables with some co-efficients such as 2a + 3a, then we have to separately add there co-efficients and take one variable to be shown in the result, i.e. 5a.

3. If there are 2 different variables with same or different co-efficients, we know that we can not perform addition operation on two different variables in algebra.
