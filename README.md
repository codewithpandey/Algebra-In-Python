Trying to solve algebric expressions in Python.

# Research and Analysis for the Project

Let's solve algebra using python programs.
In an algebric expression we don not have a numeric value which can be calculated.
So we have to do evry step that we do in our copies.
For example normally by multiplication we mean to multiply two values. But as for in algbra we have to perform a concatination operation.
i.e. a * b = ab.
Again, if there is any exponent for the given variable they should be added and also the coefficients are to be multiplied arithmetically.
for division we will leave as it is i.e. a/b
